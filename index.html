      <h2>In nature, Good & Evil do not exist.</h2>
      <p>
        The Universe itself is neither good nor bad, but a potential in
        permanent development.

        Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth's face. From that
        rock's perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing
        cares about your problems. Up there, it's just not serious, and there's
        no such thing as an issue. Down here, the only reality is the one inside
        our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn't think it. Nothing exists
        neither if our senses don't transmit the message. That means that if we
        mis sense, our reality changes. That's possible because our perception
        is limited : you can't see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
        translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our
        reality changes depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change
        reality that much, everything's fake. They're proofs to that. Fall in
        love with someone and you'll see that person as divine. Pull yourself
        out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground,
        revealing him or herself differently. But the person is the same, you
        just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it's not just that
        you can make your world, it's that you passively do it anyway.

      <h2 class="old">The story</h2>

        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
        evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We
        are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”
        The farmer said, <blockquote class="farmer"><em>"IS IT <cite class="Good">GOOD</cite>? IS IT <cite class="Bad">BAD</cite>? I DON'T KNOW."</em></blockquote>  The next day the
        horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
        everybody came back and said, <blockquote class="Villagers"><em>"OH, ISN'T THAT LUCKY. WHAT A GREAT TURN
          OF EVENTS. YOU NOW HAVE EIGHT HORSES!"</em> </blockquote> The farmer again said, <blockquote  class="farmer"><em>“IS IT
            <cite class="Good">GOOD</cite>? IS IT <cite class="Bad">BAD</cite>? I DON'T KNOW."</em></blockquote>  The following day his son tried to break
        one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
        The neighbors then said, <blockquote class="Villagers"> <em>"OH DEAR, THAT'S TOO <cite class="Bad">BAD</cite>?"</em></blockquote> and the farmer
        responded, <blockquote class="farmer"><em>
          “IS IT <cite class="Good">GOOD</cite>? IS IT <cite class="Bad">BAD</cite>? I DON'T KNOW.”</em></blockquote> The next day the
        conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and
        they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the
        neighbors came around and said, <blockquote class="Villagers"><em>"ISN'T THAT GREAT!” </em></blockquote>again, he said,<blockquote class="farmer"><em>“IS
        IT <cite class="Good">GOOD</cite>? IS IT <cite class="Bad">BAD</cite> ?I DON'T KNOW."</em></blockquote>   The whole process of nature is an
        integrated process of immense complexity, and it's really impossible to
        tell whether anything that happens in it is <cite class="Good">good</cite> or <cite class="Bad">bad</cite> — because you
        never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never
        know what will be the consequences of <cite class="Good">good</cite> fortune. Alan Watts

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        <cite class="Good">Good</cite> and <cite class="Bad">Bad</cite> are just one perspective. Bananas are <cite class="Good">good</cite> for monkeys, but
        monkeys are not <cite class="Good">good</cite> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
